# Collaborative Project: Bee species richness after Oregon wildfires

**Team Members:** Alison Carmichael and Vincent Cortes  
**Course / Lab / Context:** BI410 - Data science for ecological conservation 

This repository contains the collaborative work on Oregon Bee Atlas collaborative project. Over several weeks, multiple scripts, datasets, and experiments were developed.

## Final Version Files

The following files represent the **final, polished versions** of our project outputs:

- `CARMICHAEL_OregonBeesAndWildfires_FinalProjectWriteUp.rmd` — Final analysis notebook containing all code and results and a written report summarizing methods and findings   
- `Project/data/OBA_2018-2023.csv` — Bee dataset used in the final analysis
- `Project/data/LionsHead/or4472312167920200817_20200810_20210810_burn_bndy.shp` — Lions head fire dataset used in the final analysis
- `Project/data/BeachieCreek/or4482112218820200816_20200810_20210810_burn_bndy.shp` — Beachie Creek fire dataset used in the final analysis
- `Project/data/Riverside/or4504912206220200908_20190720_20210725_burn_bndy.shp` — Riverside fire dataset used in the final analysis

> ⚠️ Note: Other scripts, datasets, and earlier versions in this repository are part of the project history but were not used in the final analysis.

## Dataset

- The **final datasets** used in the analysis are `CARMICHAEL_OregonBeesAndWildfires_FinalProjectWriteUp.rmd`, `project/data/OBA_2018-2023.csv`, `Project/data/LionsHead/or4472312167920200817_20200810_20210810_burn_bndy.shp`, `Project/data/BeachieCreek/or4482112218820200816_20200810_20210810_burn_bndy.shp`, and `Project/data/Riverside/or4504912206220200908_20190720_20210725_burn_bndy.shp`.
- Earlier datasets and raw data are retained in the repo for transparency but are **not necessary** for reproducing the final analysis.  
- To use the datasets, access the project folder then data then folder for each fire. Bee data is in the data folder.

## Running the Analysis

1. Ensure all required packages are installed:
   - For R: `terra, ggplot2, dplyr, sf, maps, ggspatial, plotly, knitr, stringr, vegan, igraph, networkD3`   
2. Open `CARMICHAEL_OregonBeesAndWildfires_FinalProjectWriteUp.rmd` in RStudio and run all chunks.

## Notes on Repository

- This repository maintains the **full commit history** of the collaborative project.  
- Only the files listed under **Final Version Files** are required for reproducing the final results.  
- Older scripts and experimental notebooks are included for transparency and learning purposes.
