## Final Version Files

The following files represent the **final, polished versions** of our project outputs:

- `CARMICHAEL_OregonBeesAndWildfires_FinalProjectWriteUp.rmd` — Final analysis notebook containing all code and results and a written report summarizing methods and findings   
- `project/data/OBA_2018-2023.csv` — Bee dataset used in the final analysis
- `project/data/LionsHead/` — Lions head fire dataset used in the final analysis
- `project/data/BeachieCreek/` — Beachie Creek fire dataset used in the final analysis
- `project/data/Riverside/` — Riverside fire dataset used in the final analysis

> ⚠️ Note: Other scripts, datasets, and earlier versions in this repository are part of the project history but were not used in the final analysis.

## Dataset

- The **final datasets** used in the analysis are `CARMICHAEL_OregonBeesAndWildfires_FinalProjectWriteUp.rmd`, `project/data/OBA_2018-2023.csv`, `project/data/LionsHead/`, `project/data/BeachieCreek/`, and `project/data/Riverside/`.
- Earlier datasets and raw data are retained in the repo for transparency but are **not necessary** for reproducing the final analysis.  
- To use the datasets, access the project folder then data then folder for each fire. Bee data is in the data folder.

## Running the Analysis

1. Ensure all required packages are installed:
   - For R: `[list packages]`   
2. Open `CARMICHAEL_OregonBeesAndWildfires_FinalProjectWriteUp.rmd` in RStudio and run all chunks.
