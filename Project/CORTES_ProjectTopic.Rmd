**General topic of interest in relation to the Oregon Bee Atlas data (e.g., patterns of diversity, bee diets, sampling bias)**

I would want to pursue a topic surrounding bee diversity in different habitats like Coastal regions vs inland or comparing forests, grasslands/plains, and urban environments. 

Another Idea I had was to see how invasive plant species affect bee population and richness compared to non-invasive plant species.

**Potential questions within that topic area**

1.a What habitats foster a better environment to allow a wide variety of species to thrive?


2.a Do invasive plant species harm bee populations, if so what species of bee are most affected by this?
	
2.b What invasive plant species cause the most harm to bee diversity?


**Potential additional datasets within that topic area (e.g.,specify relevant government databases, academic data repositories, etc)**

**Oregon Bee Atlas:** Has data on bee populations, along with metadata surrounding location and plants nearby.

**iNaturalist Database:** Full of bee and plant sightings that could complement observations from the OBA data.

**USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Maps:** This could be used to understand the climatic conditions in different regions of Oregon (coastal vs. inland).

**Oregon Spatial Data Library:** Good data on land cover, elevation, and habitat types (forests, grasslands, urban environments).

**Global Biodiversity Information Facility:** To get additional records on species distributions of Oregon-specific pollinators.

**NOAA Climate Data:** To examine climate variables like temperature and precipitation in different regions. Useful to compare coastal to inland.

**Land Use and Cover Data:** Also good for land cover in coastal, forest, grassland, and urban areas.

**USDA PLANTS Database:** Has data on invasive plant species 

**Oregon Invasive Species Council:** Provides detailed data on invasive species in the state.

**Calflora Database:** More data on invasive and non-invasive plant species across the western United States.

**Oregon State University Extension:** 

**The name of your partner (if undergrads)**

 I donâ€™t have a partner at the moment.
