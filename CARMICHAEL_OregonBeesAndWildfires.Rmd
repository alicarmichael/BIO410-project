# General topic of interest in relation to the Oregon Bee Atlas data 
We want to focus our project on the impact of wildfires and how their devastation of ecosystems influences bee populations.

# Potential questions within that topic area
How does species richness in bee populations differ in areas affected by recent wildfires? We can compare this to areas that are left unaffected.
How fast do bee populations recover in areas affected by wildfires? How do these timelines differ between habitats?
Does wildfire severity play a role in bee abundance and richness?
What traits make bees more resilient to wildfires/ ecological disturbances?
How do bee and Native plant species differ in areas before and after wildfires?
How does the availability of Native floral resources post-wildfire ecosystems influence bee populations?
Does wildfire affect the patterns of seasonal bee behaviors? 

# Potential additional datasets within that topic area (e.g., specify relevant government databases, academic data repositories, etc)

I. Literature review
We expect the literature review will be around 5 well-cited paragraphs that do the following:
Introduce the problem and explain why
Set the stage for the problem

https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection

Put the concept and question into context


Lots of big-picture citations (such as reviews) in the first paragraph
Past work and data available
Who has addressed this problem (perhaps with a different dataset/region), and what did they do it?

What are the data available to address this problem (in addition to the OBA dataset)?

Purpose of the study
Further refine your approach (e.g., what data will you combine, how will you address the question)


Justify why this is needed now (e.g., visualization to test a new dimension of the question or better convey an old one)

Hypotheses/questions
List these clearly and in a logical order


Make hypotheses directionally using predictions (e.g. “I predict urbanization will reduce plant diversity” rather than “I predict urbanization will change plant diversity”)

II. Dataset identification
Please identify the additional datasets you will be using to address your question. * Provide the data source (including web url) * Describe sufficient metadata to convey who collected the data, how it was collected, and what each column contains.
III. Workflow plan
In pros, please describe the workflow you will use tidy your raw data, manipulate and summarize it in relevant ways, test you hypothesis, and visualize it.The goal here is to develop a logic to your workflow before you code. * Include any needed cleaning steps (e.g., “remove non-species such as ‘fly’ from the species column”) * Include any aggregation steps (e.g., “count the number of entries by region and year to calculate species richness”). * Include descriptions of any functions/for loops you will write.
* Include a description the the statistical test you will use, and how you will apply it programatically (i.e., I will simulate the null hypothesis by shuffling the labels…“)
 
IV. Partner contributions
Each person will turn in a separate document, though the above content will be the same. Here, summarize how each partner contributed. Ex: "We met and discussed the workflow plan together and wrote it together. We both made an annotated bibliography of the available studies, and then I summarized them. My partner reviewed what I wrote and edited it. My partner drafted the purpose of the study, and I gave edits."
